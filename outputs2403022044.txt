Final Answer: 1. **Google AI's LaMDA can now generate images from text descriptions**
Google AI's LaMDA language model can now generate images from text descriptions, the company announced today. This is a significant advance in the field of generative AI, as it allows AI systems to create new visual content from scratch.

2. **OpenAI's ChatGPT passes the Turing test**
OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has passed the Turing test, a test designed to measure a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from that of a human. This is a major milestone in the development of AI, as it suggests that AI systems are becoming increasingly capable of understanding and responding to human language.

3. **DeepMind's AlphaFold predicts the structure of nearly all proteins known to science**
DeepMind's AlphaFold AI system has predicted the structure of nearly all proteins known to science, a major breakthrough in the field of protein folding. This will allow scientists to better understand how proteins work and could lead to new treatments for diseases.

4. **Microsoft and NVIDIA announce partnership to develop AI supercomputer**
Microsoft and NVIDIA have announced a partnership to develop a new AI supercomputer that will be used to train and deploy AI models. The supercomputer will be one of the most powerful in the world and will help to accelerate the development of AI technology.

5. **Amazon launches new AI service to help businesses build and deploy AI models**
Amazon has launched a new AI service called Amazon SageMaker Canvas that will help businesses build and deploy AI models without having to write any code. The service will make it easier for businesses to use AI to improve their operations.
